Patch Tuesday is a term used to refer to the **second Tuesday of every month**, when software companies like Microsoft release security patches and updates for their products. 

These patches address various issues, including:

* **Security vulnerabilities:** These are holes in software code that hackers can exploit to gain access to systems or data. 
* **Bugs:** These are errors in the code that can cause the software to malfunction.
* **Improvements:**  Some updates may also include improvements to the software's performance or usability.

Patch Tuesday is an important day for system administrators, who need to install these updates to keep their systems secure and functioning properly. It's also a common time for other software companies, like Adobe and Oracle, to release their own updates.
